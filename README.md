# 🤯 Wait, What Time Is It Again? A No-BS Guide to DST 🌏

Ever stared at your screen wondering why your meeting mysteriously shifted by an hour? Yeah, that's probably **Daylight Saving Time (DST)**, the twice-a-year time warp that messes with everyone's schedule. This repo is your new best friend for figuring it all out, especially if you're chilling in Vietnam (ICT / UTC+7) and trying to keep up with the rest of the world.

> **Fun Fact:** Vietnam doesn't do DST. We're consistent. We're stable. We're basically the rock in a chaotic sea of time zones. 😉

## So, What's the Big Deal with DST?

Long story short, some countries "spring forward" by an hour in the spring and "fall back" in the autumn. The idea was to save energy by making better use of natural daylight. Whether it actually works is a whole other can of worms, but for now, we just have to deal with it.

This guide breaks down the madness from a **Vietnam Time (ICT / UTC+7)** perspective, so you'll never be late (or awkwardly early) again.

## 🇪🇺 Europe: The "Last Sunday" Crew

Our friends in Europe like to keep things (mostly) synchronized. They make the switch on the **last Sunday of March and October**.

### 🌸 Spring Forward: Last Sunday of March
At **8:00 AM sharp in Vietnam**, Europe does its time-hop thing.

- **1:59 AM in Central Europe (CET)** becomes **2:00 AM (CEST)**. Poof!
- Basically, everyone collectively agrees to lose an hour of sleep. solidarity!

### 🍂 Fall Back: Last Sunday of October
Also at **8:00 AM in Vietnam**, Europe gets that hour back.

- **1:59 AM in Central Europe (CEST)** becomes... **1:00 AM (CET)** again. Groundhog Day, anyone?
- That extra hour of sleep, though. Sweet.

## 🇺🇸🇨🇦 US & Canada: The Rule-Benders

North America likes to be a little different. They've got their own schedule and a bunch of exceptions that make you go "huh?"

### 🌸 Spring Forward: 2nd Sunday of March
This one's a rolling change. As each time zone hits **2:00 AM**, it jumps to **3:00 AM**. From Vietnam, it looks like this:

- **East Coast (EST → EDT):** Jumps at **2:00 PM ICT**
- **West Coast (PST → PDT):** Jumps at **5:00 PM ICT**

### 🍂 Fall Back: 1st Sunday of November
Same deal, but in reverse. As each time zone hits **2:00 AM**, it rewinds to **1:00 AM**.

- **East Coast (EDT → EST):** Falls back at **1:00 PM ICT**
- **West Coast (PDT → PST):** Falls back at **4:00 PM ICT**

> **⚠️ Heads Up!** Not everyone in North America is in on this. Arizona, Hawaii, and Saskatchewan are just a few of the rebels who don't do DST. Mad respect.

## 🇦🇺🇳🇿 Australia & New Zealand: The Upside-Downers

Because they're in the Southern Hemisphere, their seasons are flipped. So, their DST is the opposite of the northern crew. It's a whole vibe.

### 🌸 Spring Forward (for them, our autumn):
- **New Zealand:** Jumps forward on the **last Sunday of September** (around 9:00 PM ICT the day before).
- **Australia:** Jumps forward on the **first Sunday of October** (around 11:00 PM ICT the day before).

### 🍂 Fall Back (for them, our spring):
- **Everyone:** Falls back on the **first Sunday of April** (around 11:00 PM ICT the day before).

> **⚠️ Aussie Exceptions:** Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory are too cool for DST. They stick to their guns year-round.
